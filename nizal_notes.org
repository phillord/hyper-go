** High/Low Affinity

A substance or substances transported with high and low affinity such as Zinc ions.

(DT): High and low affinity are properties of the transporter.
      Define a property BindingAffinity which will be a value-partition with highaffinity and lowaffinity.

ISSUE: In the case that the same chemical element transported once in high affinity and later in low affininty, linking those with same term from chebi ontology cause ontology inconsistent

CAUSE: Ontology inconsistenc, due to linking the same concept (i.e. chebi term) via the same object property to different values in a value partition.

SOLUTION: Define two object properties called cargo-with-high-affinity and cargo-with-low-affinity
